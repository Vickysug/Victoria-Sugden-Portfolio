# Unit 2 Challenge: Portfolio

## My Task

My task is to build a portfolio page, which I can add to as the course progresses. 

A portfolio of work to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio will highlight my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies. 

With these points in mind, in this challenge I will set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I have recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. I will get to practice my new skills while creating something that I will use during my job search. 

As I dont don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, I can use placeholder images and names. I can change them to real applications as I create them later in the course.

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
